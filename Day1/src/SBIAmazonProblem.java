Amazon eCommerce Grand Sale
SBI : 10% Discount -> Card Usage
1. HomeAndKitchen
2. MobileDevice

Problem Statement:
where SBI should advertise in an offline manner to sell credit cards more by putting up a stall :)

HomeAndKitchen discount
day1Sales -> 223451 10%
day2Sales -> 323452 10%
day3Sales -> 423459 10%

MobileDevice discount
day1Sales -> 1223451 10%
day2Sales -> 2323452 10%
day3Sales -> 3423459 10%

Problems are Mathematical Always

MODEL
Data Storage Containers -> Focus on Storing Data which we will process to solve the problem
1. Single Value Containers
instagram user id
2. Multi Value Containers
Homo : Same type of data | album of images on instagram
Hetro : different type of data | album of images & videos on instagram

ShoppingCart on Amazon is a Storage Container

Storage Containers -> 1. Fixed Size i.e. in memory they will take a particular amount of memory which is pre-defined
This cannot be altered
static storage containers whose sizes cannot be altered
2. Variable Size i.e. memory can increase or decrease as per our requirements
dynamic storage containers whose size cannot be altered
VIEW
User Interface i.e. where user can give data as input or we process data and show the output
Web, Mobile, Desktop, CommandLine
CONTROLLER
Logical Processing on Data
1. Computation -> Mathematical Operations
2. Conditional Flows -> Taking the decision
3. Iterations -> Doing something again and again
